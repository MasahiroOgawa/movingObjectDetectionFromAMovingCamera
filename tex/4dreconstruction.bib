abstract = {Moving object detection is the foundation of research in many computer vision fields. In recent decades, a number of detection methods have been proposed. Relevant surveys mainly focused on the detection accuracy, while different practical detection tasks were not considered. However, in different application tasks, training modes and requirements are completely different. The purpose of this survey is to classify and evaluate recent moving object detection methods from a practical perspective. Two main types of practical application tasks are considered: the detection of seen scenes and the detection of unseen scenes. In the survey, two practical application tasks are defined, corresponding recent moving object detection technologies are reviewed, and future directions are suggested to provide references for researchers and technicians when choosing suitable algorithms in practical work.}
